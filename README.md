# About this project

Aim for this project is cloning existing website to test my knowledge and improve my skills for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(including React.js) .

I chose [https://www.skipthedishes.com/]("Skip the Dishes") for the website to clone because it uses a lot of cool designs like carousel, diagonal lines to divide text and images, and a beautiful color combinations.

Of course it is a responsive website, having both mobile and desktop version.

## Website
You can visit my demo website from [https://skip-clone.vercel.app/](here).

## Things I learned

- How to use before/after pseudo-elements(I used them to implement diagonal lines)

- How to build a carousel from scrach (without using any libraries)

- How to check the pixel which a user scroll a screen (I used scrollY, scrollLeft)

## Future Improvement

- Write shorter code using SASS/SCSS or dividing CSS files by component
